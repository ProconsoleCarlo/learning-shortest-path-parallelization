Maximum time complexity:
Density = 100%
E = edges = 241989000
V = vertices = 22000
Dijkstra = O(E+V*logV) = O(2'028'808'319)
Bellman Ford = O(V*E) = O(5'323'758'000'000)

Bellman Ford is complex 2600 times more with 100% density !!!!
DON'T go over 5000 vertices with 25% density for Bellman Ford, so that in parallel, to me, it takes 190.339000s against Dijkstra 0.160000s
In serial execution it should take about 571s!!
