# Java implementation

This project has been developed as an exercise, in the time between 19/06/2022 and 17/07/2022.

The purpose was to show a possible implementation in the Java language of two algorithms that compute the shortest path in
a graph (Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford) and a possible parallelization of them using the Java 8 streams.
